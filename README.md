# 2023 MLB Analysis

**About this Project:**
Baseball has become more and more analytical over the years, so why not use some recently acquired data analytics tools to analyze 2023 MLB data. No matter whether youâ€™re a die-hard baseball fan or a complete beginner, the insights and takeaways from this project will help you better understand player and team performance and potentially help you find your new favorite team or player. 

**Project Workflow:**

**Data Gathering and Storage:** I visited Kaggle to find a dataset that includes 2023 MLB performance data. 

I created an ERD using QuickDB to design my database schema and then uploaded my data into PostgreSQL

**Data Cleaning:**
I imported my data into a Jupyter Notebook and used Pandas & ETL to clean the data. 

Cleaning included checking for nulls, renaming columns, etc. 

**Data Analysis:**
I imported my cleaned data into PostgreSQL and began performing Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to explore my dataset.

**Data Visualization:**
Using Jupyter Notebook I used Matplotlib, Seaborn,  and Plotly Express to create my charts. 

Separately, I created a Tableau dashboard to visualize the data.
